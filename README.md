#### About Me
As an experienced IT professional with a passion for innovation, I have gained extensive expertise in AWS, DevOps, and Databases. Throughout my career, I have worked on numerous complex projects, developing and implementing cloud-based solutions to meet business needs. My experience in these areas has given me a strong foundation in infrastructure design, deployment, and management, as well as expertise in automation, CI/CD pipelines, and monitoring tools.

Currently, I am learning data science to augment my technical skills and stay ahead of the curve in this rapidly evolving field. I am excited to explore the various aspects of data science, including data visualization, statistical modeling, and machine learning, and applying my knowledge to solve real-world problems.

I am eager to collaborate with like-minded individuals and contribute to open-source projects that align with my interests. With a strong commitment to continuous learning and professional development, I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to expand my skill set.
